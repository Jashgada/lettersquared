## Lettersquared
I love my nightly ritual of solving new york times games. One of those games is letterboxed.
The object is simple - use all the letters in a 3x3 square (not a **box**) to form words.
The constraint here is that you cannot use two letters from the same side consecutively.
Thats all! 

This project will hopefully be able to solve it in the least possible words.
